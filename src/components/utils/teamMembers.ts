    bio: [
      'I was born and grew up in Belarus, in the city of Svetlogorsk. Since childhood I was fascinated by computers and the internet, and dreamed of creating my own websites.

I did different projects for myself and for my friends, and gradually gained experience and confidence in my skills.',
      'In 2017, I got a job at a small web studio where I did website layout for different clients. I worked in a team with other developers, designers and managers and I loved what I was doing.

I wanted to expand my capabilities and become a full-fledged web developer, not just a layout designer.'
